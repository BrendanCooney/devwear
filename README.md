# DEVWEAR - Portfolio Project 5
Welcome To DevWear,
The Apparel Store for Developers!

[Link to live Website:](https://devwear-0c4ac54770df.herokuapp.com)



When designing this site, I wanted to keep the design simple. Due to time constraints I kept much of the CSS used in our walktough project. I do like the design and it is simple and clean. The goal of the site was to show that it can be quite simple to design and generate apparel products for Ecommerce



Build and SetupTechnologies:
This Ecommerce Project uses:

## Responsive Layout

The layout is responsive and has been tested with various screen sizes. This screenshot was taken with the ui.dev/amiresponsive website.


## Product Design
All products were designed by myself with Canva and Printful. Most of the designs have been created in black and white. All designs have only two colours keeping them simple and getting the message accross clearly. 

Each image was created as below and then imported into printful to create mockups.

The Mockups were then converted into T-Shirt images for the store.

## Typography 

The Lato font family was used when creating and working on this project. I used Lato on Canva to produce the logo for the brand which matches the Lato Logo font used in the header of the site for the logo.

## Agile Development Process:

GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects served as the Agile tool for the Devwear project. Github used correctly  with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments can work nicely for project management. 

Below you can see the clearly planned out user stories and completed stories on the KANBAN Board.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

## User Stories
I used Excel to create a user story template and continued to create all user stories in Github projects.
